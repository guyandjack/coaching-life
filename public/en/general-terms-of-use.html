                        of the
                        site '<strong>socoaching.ch</strong>' and its services. This contract is concluded between the
                        "PUBLISHER" and the "USER". The "T&Cs" must be accepted by any "USER", and access to the site
                        constitutes acceptance of these terms. The "T&Cs" are governed by Swiss law, regardless of the
                        place of use of the service. Any dispute that may arise between the "PUBLISHER" and the "USER",
                        after
                        all attempts to find an amicable solution have failed, will be under the exclusive jurisdiction
                        of the courts
                        where the "PUBLISHER" is located. The reference language for the settlement of any dispute is
                        French.
